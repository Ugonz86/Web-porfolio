        <h3>Bio</h3>

        <p1>Born and raised in Puerto Rico. I moved from the small Caribbean island to <strong>Seattle</strong> at the end of 2012 pursuing ambition and exciting new experiences.
          At this moment, I work in risk management, dealing with credit card fraudsters and basically, catching hackers. Interesting, right?
          Instead of an investigative work, I am pursuing a career that requires more creativity and techinicality which is why I have decided to join <a class="contact">Epicodus.</a>
          Some of my biggest interestes include surfing, snowmobile, snowboarding, fly boarding, hiking and all that involves nature.
          I am also a bit of an epicure and enthusiast of a fun lifestyle. I always visit a new country every year and learning about ancient culture, language and history is one of the things i am truly passionate about.
          As a foreign person, my favorite part of a chat is catching new words and slang to expand my English lexic.

          Back to <a class="contact">web programming.</a> This is something I have been trying to do for years and it's because I find it difficult and I'm all about life challenges in general, but also, the creative part fascinates me.
          We can do so much with this skill-set we are learning. I can't wait to see us all succeed!
